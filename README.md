Methods of Data Analysis II
The contents will focus on the exponential family, generalized linear models (GLMs), quasi-likelihood, generalized estimating equations (GEEs), linear mixed models, generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) and generalized additive models (GAMs). Statistical analysis will be conducted using R. 

Contents also include: analysis of variance for one-and two-way layouts, logistic regression, loglinear models, longitudinal data, introduction to time series.

The course includes:
• application of methods through problem-solving questions;
• description and explanation of concepts relating to the mathematical theory;
• derivation and proof of topics based on GLM concepts and theory;
• practical application of methods on real data using statistical software R, with appropriate justification of use of these methods;
• interpretation of data analysis results in clear and non-technical language;
